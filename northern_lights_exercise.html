        <p>The bright dancing lights of the aurora are actually collisions between electrically charged particles from the sun that enter 
        the earth's atmosphere. The lights are seen above the magnetic poles of the northern and southern hemispheres. They are known as 
        'Aurora borealis' in the north and 'Aurora australis' in the south...</p>
        <p>Auroral displays appear in many colours although pale green and pink are the most common. Shades of red, yellow, green, blue, and 
        violet have been reported. The lights appear in many forms from patches or scattered clouds of light to streamers, arcs, rippling curtains 
        or shooting rays that light up the sky with an eerie glow.</p>
